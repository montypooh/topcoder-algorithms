PROBLEM STATEMENT
If X and Y are two strings of equal length N, then the difference between them is defined as the number of indices i where the i-th character of X and the i-th character of Y are different.  For example, the difference between the words "ant" and "art" is 1.

You are given two strings, A and B, where the length of A is less than or equal to the length of B.  You can apply an arbitrary number of operations to A, where each operation is one of the following:


Choose a character c and add it to the beginning of A.
Choose a character c and add it to the end of A.


Apply the operations in such a way that A and B have the same length and the difference between them is as small as possible.  Return this minimum possible difference.

DEFINITION
Class:DifferentStrings
Method:minimize
Parameters:string, string
Returns:int
Method signature:int minimize(string A, string B)


CONSTRAINTS
-A and B will each contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-A and B will both contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z').
-The length of A will be less than or equal to the length of B.


EXAMPLES

0)
"koder"
"topcoder"

Returns: 1

You can prepend "top" to "koder" and you'll get "topkoder". The difference between "topkoder" and "topcoder" is 1.

1)
"hello"
"xello"

Returns: 1

A and B already have the same length so you cannot add any characters to A.

2)
"abc"
"topabcoder"

Returns: 0



3)
"adaabc"
"aababbc"

Returns: 2



4)
"giorgi"
"igroig"

Returns: 6
