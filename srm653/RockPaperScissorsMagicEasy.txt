PROBLEM STATEMENT

Alice and Bob are going to play a variant of the traditional rock-paper-scissors game.
Their game is played using cards.
Each card shows one of the three pictures: a rock, a paper, or scissors.
There is a sufficient supply of cards of each type.
Bob has already chosen a sequence of cards and he has arranged them into a row, face down.
It is now Alice's turn to do the same.
Once she does that, they will use the two sequences of cards to play the game:
For each i, Alice's i-th card and Bob's i-th card will be revealed and compared using the standard rules of rock-paper-scissors.
Whenever Alice's card wins, Alice gets a point.
Alice gets no points for a loss or a tie.



Alice has marked Bob's cards, so now she can tell which card has which symbol on it.
You are given this information as a vector <int> card.
Each element of card is between 0 and 2, inclusive: 0 is a rock, 1 is a paper, and 2 are scissors.



You are also given an int score.
Alice has just announced that she will get a total of score points.



Let X be the number of sequences in which Alice can play her cards if she wants to achieve exactly score points.
Return the value (X modulo 1,000,000,007).

Bob has played his cards in the order rock-paper-scissors.
Alice wants to score 2 points.
Hence, she must win twice, and lose to Bob or tie him once.



One possible way in which she can play her cards is paper-scissors-scissors:
her paper beats Bob's rock (1 point), scissors beat paper (1 point), and scissors tie with scissors (0 points).



There are five other ways how Alice can score 2 points: paper-scissors-paper, paper-paper-rock, paper-rock-rock, rock-scissors-rock, and scissors-scissors-rock.
